# History Of Classboard
### Part 1: A Tale Of 2 Tech Nerds
One Upon A Time There Were 2 Tech Nerds
SyntaxError52, and cobblesteve01
Syntax Made EDUPort and cobblesteve made *Classboard*
Syntax the next day abandoned his website in a Trash Bin
He joined *Classboard*
### Part 2: A Tale Of 2 Websites
Then, another website arose. Terms Tec, it was called. Originated from 5th grade, it aimed to be the most used website. So its owner, Mr. T, made it just like Classboard. Same buttons, same style, same everything. There was some drama going around for who owned the best website. Yet another website came around, ALSO made by Mr. T, but he claimed he didn't make it. One or two months later, he deleted the website and removed it from the servers of Google Sites, and Classboard was the greatest website once again.
SyntaxError52 also had some public email beef with Mr. T during the height of the drama. He started a public email battle. Literally added everyone as a recipient. It got so bad that other people had asked him to stop. He was just going back and forth with Mr. T. They eventually stopped.

### Part 3: The Great Migration
```Written From The Perspective of SyntaxError52```
Ever since the beginning of Classboard me and cobblesteve had a dream.
Going on our school website
So after the *Terms Tec* drama was sorted out me and cobblesteve emailed the principal: Dr. I 
The email was similar to:
```Dr.I, We would like to be on the school website. Can we schedule a meeting to discuss this?```
She said yes.
And she basically said no.
And you better base the development of your personal emails.
So we did.
It took like a week but it was worth it.
### Part 4: *A Tale Of Dumb Chatrooms*
Basically cobblesteve (cobblesteve01) said to me (SyntaxError52), "I'm gonna make a chatroom so people can stay connected with friends, even during boring classes. It's going to be great!! ;)
Bad idea is what I said.
I was right apparently.

```Switching to cobblesteve's perspective.```

I was hard at work trying to find a reliable service to host the chatroom on. First, I found DeadSimpleChat. A great-looking chatroom service, and I tested it out and everything worked. I decided to test it on my school chromebook, only to see it was blocked. I tried over and over again, trying to find a chatroom service, but I couldn't find any that were free or not blocked. But then, Roomlio, the free chatroom that wasn't blocked on our computers. I set everything up and got ready for release....
####  Day 1: Hi Mom, I'm On Classchat
This consisted of random ppl playing around. They crashed the servers in the first two minutes of release.
#### Day 2: MONKE
Someone sent a huge line of HTML code which I thought was NSFW. 
It was a pixel art gorilla.
#### Day 3: Ni-ckelodeon
So basically someone in the middle of the day had to send a message.
```Trafis Scoot - n*****```
You can infer
#### Day 4: The Principal's Office
```Written From the Perspective of cobblesteve01```
1st period advanced math. Bored to death. Then, over the announcments, they say: ```Can we have [cobblesteve's name] to the office please?```
You can guess where I'm going, right?
Literally sweating. Into the office I go, and the office lady is like: ```Dr. I wants to see you.``` I'm definitely in trouble. I walk in there, and to make it worse, the assistant principal is ALSO there! I sit down, and long story short, they told me they might have to block it and they are amazed at Classboard. So yeah, the whole team is panicking, I'm scared for my life, and everything is coming down on me. One month later, it ended up getting blocked.
### A sad day. (Written from the perspective of cobblesteve)
That day, we woke up, and Classboard was blocked. My jaw dropped and I was absoluteley stunned. Then, Dev T had a great idea. Let's change the URL! And I'm like: Heck naw man! That's gonna get us in more trouble! A week later, I didn't give a crap and followed through with it. Just like that, it was unblocked.
